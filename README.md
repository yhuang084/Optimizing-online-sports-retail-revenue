# Optimizing-online-sports-retail-revenue
In this notebook, we dive deep and query a database that contains sales data from an online sports retailer to provide suggestions on optimizing retail revenues.
Based on the explorary data analysis, we can provide four key findings: 
1) There are in total of 77 unique products on the online retail platform. And it is good for targeting customers with different needs;
2) Compared to Nike, the store has more expensive ( higher than $129) Adidas products, has higher average discount;
3) There is a strong positive relationship between customer reviews upon products and retail revenue. Most of customer reviews occurred in Q1;
4) Compared to clothing category, footwear has more products and brings more revenue.

   
Accordingly, we can provide the following four suggestions to optimize online retail revenues:
1) The store should increase the stock of Adidas products that are $129 or higher;
2) To promote the sale of Nike products, the store can offer discounts;
3) The store should incentivize customers provide reviews, especially during Q1;
4) The store should optimize its inventory by increasing footwear stock
